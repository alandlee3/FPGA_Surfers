# FPGA Surfers
Welcome to the Greatest Github Repository of All Time for the Greatest FPGA Project of All Time written by the Greatest FPGA Engineers OF ALL TIME.

## Running Instructions.
You can either build the project or use our build, which is in `/builds/final/final.bit`.

**IMPORTANT:** After flashing to the FPGA, the speed is determined by sw[4:7]. To play the game, switch on your desired speed setting (we recommend sw[7] for the full FPGA Surfer experience), and do not change the speed setting during a run. If no switches are on, the game will pause. If the game is lost, toggle sw[0] to reset the game. The FPGA's buttons are used to control the player.
