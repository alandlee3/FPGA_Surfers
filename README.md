# FPGA Surfers

Welcome to the Greatest Github Repository of All Time for the Greatest FPGA Project of All Time written by the Greatest FPGA Engineers OF ALL TIME.

## Overview Video

Consult the following video for an overview of the project design and insights: [The Greatest FPGA Project of All Time](https://youtu.be/YAY15MsrshE)

## Running Instructions.

You can either build the project or use our build, which is in `/builds/final/final.bit`.

**IMPORTANT:** After flashing to the FPGA, the speed is determined by sw[4:7]. To play the game, switch on your desired speed setting (we recommend sw[7] for the full FPGA Surfer experience), and do not change the speed setting during a run. If no switches are on, the game will pause. If the game is lost, toggle sw[0] to reset the game. The FPGA's buttons are used to control the player: the farthest left and right buttons are used for left and right inputs, respectively, while the center left button is for ducking and the center right button is for jumping.

## Critical Reception

Critically acclaimed FPGA Surfers has been widely regarded as the Greatest Game of All Time.

"This is the Greatest Game of All Time" - Roger Joey Fan (The Greatest FPGA Engineer of All Time)\
"This is the Greatest Game of All Time" - Alan Dong Jin Lee (The Greatest FPGA Aggressive Omega of All Time)\
"The fact that you got it looking as good as you did is really, really" - Joe Steinmeyer (The Greatest FPGA Lecturer of All Time)
